xTap is a Chrome extension that passively reads the GraphQL responses X/Twitter already sends to your browser and saves captured tweets as structured JSONL. It does not patch X's page code or make extra X requests for ordinary capture.

## Features

- **Zero footprint** — no additional network requests; captures what your browser already receives
- **Structured output** — each tweet saved as a clean JSON object with author, metrics, media, and more
- **Article support** — long-form X articles are captured when X returns the full body, with inline image references and Draft.js block structure
- **Video download** — download videos from tweets using yt-dlp (or direct MP4 fallback) via the extension popup. Requires the HTTP daemon. **Note:** unlike passive capture, video downloads make additional network requests to X and are not stealth.
- **Image download** — opt-in toggle in the popup ("Download images automatically") fetches photos from `pbs.twimg.com` to `<output_dir>/media/<tweet_id>/<filename>` as you browse. If enabled after browsing, already-seen photo tweets are rechecked for media download without bumping the captured-tweet counter. Daemon-side; rate-limited; logs to `media-manifest.jsonl`. **Note:** also not stealth — adds requests to the Twitter CDN.
- **Pause / resume** — click the extension icon to toggle capture on the fly
- **Live counter** — badge on the extension icon shows tweets captured this session
- **Multi-tab aware** — multiple X tabs feed into the same service worker with shared deduplication
- **Debug logging** — optional toggle to write timestamped service worker logs to a date-rotated file
- **Debug dashboard** — internal extension page with live capture events, transport health, and a parser sandbox for testing GraphQL response parsing
- **Cross-platform** — works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## Scrape job receipts

xTap can provide capture receipts to the allowlisted [Infinite Feed Scroller](https://github.com/osolmaz/infinite-feed-scroller) extension. The scroller binds a run to a blank source tab before navigating that tab to X. xTap stores each post ID, post time, first-seen time, source endpoint, and ordered run observation in browser IndexedDB.

Live-list and search timelines use the same observation format. Up to two runs can be active. Each GraphQL response is routed only to the run bound to its Chrome tab, and finishing one run leaves the other running. The local index supports replay after an extension restart and records whether each list post was known before the run. The external port never exposes tweet text or the pool token.

## How It Works

```

1. The service worker attaches Chrome's Debugger Network domain to open X tabs.
2. It reads completed GraphQL response bodies without changing page JavaScript or the DOM.
3. The existing parser normalizes tweets, records tab-bound scrape receipts, deduplicates normal capture, and builds upload batches.
4. The HTTP daemon remains the primary disk transport. Native messaging bootstraps its token and provides the existing fallback.

## Is This Safe to Use?

xTap does not post, like, follow, scroll, or request extra X data. It records responses that Chrome received because of browsing in the attached tab.

X can still enforce its rules based on account activity, browsing patterns, or automated scrolling performed by another tool. Review those rules and use a suitable account before running long scrapes.

### Browser behavior

xTap reads responses that Chrome already received and does not send extra X requests for capture. The extension no longer replaces page fetch or XHR functions and leaves the page DOM unchanged.

- **No extra X requests** — debugger capture only reads responses the browser already received
- **No page hooks** — xTap does not patch page-owned `fetch` or XHR APIs, inject page code, or add DOM signaling
- **Extension-owned capture** — parsing, receipts, deduplication, staging, and transport stay in extension contexts

Chrome shows its standard debugger notice while xTap is attached to an X tab. Opening DevTools or another debugger can detach xTap from that tab. Reload or revisit the tab to attach again.

Capture still has account and platform risk. xTap can observe automated scrolling performed by another tool, and X can enforce its rules based on that browsing behavior.

## Installation

### Requirements

| | Requirement |
|---|---|
| **Browser** | Google Chrome |
| **Runtime** | Python 3 |
| **OS** | macOS, Linux, or Windows |
| [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp#installation) (optional) | For best-quality video downloads |

### 1. Load the extension

**Chrome:**
1. Open `chrome://extensions`
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top right)
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `xtap/` directory
4. Copy the extension ID shown on the card (used by native host install)

### 2. Install the native host

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS</strong></summary>

```bash
cd native-host
./install.sh <your-extension-id> chrome
```

This installs the native messaging host (for auth token bootstrap) and an HTTP daemon (`xtap_daemon.py`) that runs via launchd. The daemon runs independently of the browser process tree and has its own TCC permissions, so it can write to protected paths like `~/Documents` and iCloud Drive. The installer captures your current `PATH` so the daemon can find tools like `yt-dlp`.

The extension automatically detects the daemon via the native host's auth token. If the daemon is not running, the extension will show a red "!" badge and an error in the popup.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Linux</strong></summary>

```bash
cd native-host
./install.sh <your-extension-id> chrome
```

This installs the native messaging host and an HTTP daemon (`xtap_daemon.py`) that runs as a systemd user service. The daemon enables video downloads and provides the same HTTP transport as macOS.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows (PowerShell)</strong></summary>

```powershell
cd native-host
.\install.ps1 -ExtensionId <your-extension-id> -Browser chrome
```

This installs the native messaging host and an HTTP daemon (`xtap_daemon.py`) as a Windows Scheduled Task that starts at logon. The daemon enables video downloads and provides the same HTTP transport as macOS/Linux.

</details>

### 3. Browse X

Open [x.com](https://x.com) and browse normally. The badge counter on the extension icon shows how many tweets have been captured this session. Click the icon to see stats and pause/resume capture.

> **After updating the extension:** Reload xTap at `chrome://extensions`, then reload any open X tabs. The extension must reattach its passive debugger capture to those tabs.

### Upgrading from a previous version

After updating the extension files:
1. Re-run the installer (`install.sh` on macOS/Linux, `install.ps1` on Windows) — this updates the daemon configuration and picks up new Python code
2. Reload the extension in your browser extension manager
3. Hard-reload any open X tabs (`Cmd+Shift+R` / `Ctrl+Shift+R`)

**From versions before v0.20.0 on macOS/Linux:** Re-running `install.sh` is **required** — the native messaging manifest now points to a wrapper script (`~/.xtap/xtap_host_wrapper.sh`) that uses an absolute Python path, fixing native host launch failures on macOS where Chrome's minimal environment couldn't find `python3`.

**From versions before v0.19.0:** The native messaging host (`xtap_host.py`) no longer handles tweet writing — all data now flows through the HTTP daemon exclusively. Re-running `install.sh` is required to update the daemon's service configuration (adds `XTAP_LOG_LEVEL` support). The extension will show a red "!" badge if the daemon is not running, instead of silently falling back to native messaging.

**From versions before v0.13.0 on macOS:** Re-running `install.sh` is **required** for video download support — the daemon needs an updated launchd configuration to find yt-dlp on your PATH.

### Troubleshooting

If the extension shows "Not connected" or a red "!" badge:

1. **Check if the daemon is running:**
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:17381/status
   # Should return: {"ok": true, "version": "..."}
   ```

2. **Check daemon logs:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/.xtap/daemon-stderr.log
   ```
   The daemon logs startup diagnostics (Python version, output directory, token status) on every start. Common issues:
   - `FATAL: ~/.xtap/secret not found` — run `install.sh` first
   - `FATAL: Cannot bind to 127.0.0.1:17381` — another instance is already running
   - Import errors — check Python version (`python3 --version`, requires 3.x)

3. **Check native host errors** (token bootstrap failures):
   ```bash
   cat ~/.xtap/host-error.log
   ```
   This file is created when the native messaging host crashes. It includes the Python version, script path, and full traceback.

4. **Enable debug logging** for detailed request-level daemon logs:
   ```bash
   export XTAP_LOG_LEVEL=debug
   cd native-host && ./install.sh <extension-id> chrome
   ```
   Then check `~/.xtap/daemon-stderr.log` for per-request details (method, path, duration, tweet counts).

5. **Verify the native messaging manifest** points to the correct path:
   ```bash
   # Chrome (macOS):
   cat ~/Library/Application\ Support/Google/Chrome/NativeMessagingHosts/com.xtap.host.json
   ```
   The `path` field should point to `~/.xtap/xtap_host_wrapper.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `xtap_host.bat` (Windows). The wrapper uses an absolute Python path so native messaging works even in Chrome's minimal environment. If it still points directly at `xtap_host.py`, re-run `install.sh`.

## Configuration

### Output directory

The easiest way to change where tweets are saved is through the extension popup — click the xTap icon and enter your preferred path in the **Output directory** field.

Alternatively, set the `XTAP_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable and re-run the installer — the daemon runs as a system service (launchd/systemd/Scheduled Task), so the variable must be baked into the service definition; exporting it in a shell or before launching the browser has no effect:

```bash
export XTAP_OUTPUT_DIR="$HOME/Documents/xtap-data"
./native-host/install.sh <extension-id> [chrome|firefox]
```

On Windows, set it as a *user* environment variable (`[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('XTAP_OUTPUT_DIR', 'D:\\path', 'User')`) and re-run `install.ps1`.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Popup "Output directory" | *(empty — uses default)* | Overrides the output path per-session |
| `XTAP_OUTPUT_DIR` env var | `~/Downloads/xtap` | Fallback when no popup setting is configured (set at install time) |
| Debug Dashboard | — | Accessible via popup link; shows live capture events, transport health, debug logging and discovery mode toggles, and parser sandbox |

> **macOS note:** On macOS, the HTTP daemon (installed via `install.sh`) runs outside browser TCC sandboxes and can write to protected paths like `~/Documents` and iCloud Drive after a one-time macOS permission prompt.

### Download tuning

These daemon environment variables are optional. Re-run the installer after changing them so the service definition picks them up.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `XTAP_IMAGE_DELAY_MS` | `100` | Delay between background image requests |
| `XTAP_MAX_FILE_MB` | `50` | Max size for one downloaded image |
| `XTAP_MAX_MEDIA_MB` | *(unlimited)* | Max cumulative image bytes per daemon process |
| `XTAP_MAX_VIDEO_MB` | `500` | Max size for one direct MP4 fallback video download; set `0` or less to disable the cap |
| `XTAP_CONN_TIMEOUT_S` | `15` | Daemon per-connection socket timeout — drops idle/stalled connections; bad or `<=0` values fall back to the default (the timeout is never disabled) |
| `XTAP_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_S` | `10` | Max seconds the daemon waits for in-flight requests at shutdown before force-exiting; bad or `<=0` values fall back to the default |

## Output Format

Output is written to daily files (`tweets-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`). Each line is a self-contained JSON object:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "1234567890",
  "url": "https://x.com/handle/status/1234567890",
  "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "author": {

    "verified": false,
    "is_blue_verified": true,
    "follower_count": 1234
  },
  "text": "Full tweet text...",
  "lang": "en",
  "metrics": {
    "likes": 10,
    "retweets": 5,
    "replies": 2,
    "views": 1000,
    "bookmarks": 1,
    "quotes": 0
  },
  "media": [],
  "urls": [],
  "hashtags": [],
  "mentions": [],
  "in_reply_to": null,
  "quoted_tweet_id": null,
  "conversation_id": "1234567890",
  "is_retweet": false,
  "retweeted_tweet_id": null,
  "is_subscriber_only": false,          // true for subscriber-only tweets
  "is_article": true,                   // present only for long-form articles
  "article": {                          // present only for long-form articles
    "title": "Article Title",
    "text": "Rendered plain text with ![img](media/<id>/file.png) refs",
    "blocks": [],                       // raw Draft.js content_state blocks
    "media": [{                         // article image references
      "id": "...",
      "url": "https://pbs.twimg.com/...",  // original CDN URL
      "filename": "image.png",
      "local_path": "media/<tweet_id>/image.png",
      "width": 1200,
      "height": 800
    }]
  },
  "source_endpoint": "HomeTimeline",    // which GraphQL endpoint
  "captured_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

For regular tweets, `is_article` and `article` are absent. For articles, `text` contains a markdown-style rendering of the article with inline image references pointing to `media/<tweet_id>/`. Article stubs without `content_state.blocks` are skipped rather than saved as incomplete rows.

### Media file convention

When the "Download images automatically" toggle is on, the daemon writes photos to:

```
<output_dir>/media/<tweet_id>/<basename(media.url)>
```

Top-level photo `media[]` entries do **not** carry a `local_path` field — the path is derived by convention so consumers can reconstruct it directly from `tweet.id` + the URL basename. Article media (`tweet.article.media[]`) does include `local_path` because that path is also embedded in the rendered article markdown (`![](media/<id>/file.png)`) so the article body works as a self-contained document. Download status (success / 404 / quota / oversize / blocked) is appended to `<output_dir>/media-manifest.jsonl`.

## Development

After modifying extension files (`background.js`, `lib/`, or `popup.*`), reload the extension at `chrome://extensions` and hard-reload any open X tabs. Chrome asks for the Debugger permission and shows its standard notice while an X tab is attached.

**Debug dashboard:** Click "Debug Dashboard" in the popup to open a live view of capture events, transport health, and a parser sandbox for testing `extractTweets` against raw GraphQL JSON. Debug logging and discovery mode toggles are also here — enable debug logging to write timestamped service worker logs to `debug-YYYY-MM-DD.log`, or discovery mode to log endpoint response shapes to the console.

**Dev mode:** When loaded unpacked (developer mode), the extension prefers `chrome.storage.session` for the `seenIds` dedup cache, and falls back to `chrome.storage.local` if session storage APIs are unavailable. When session storage is available, reloading the extension automatically clears the cache — no need to manually clear storage between test runs.

After modifying Python host files (`xtap_core.py`, `xtap_host.py`, `xtap_daemon.py`), the native host picks up changes on next browser restart. To restart the HTTP daemon immediately:

**macOS (launchd):**
```bash
launchctl kickstart -k gui/$(id -u)/com.xtap.daemon   # restart
launchctl bootout gui/$(id -u)/com.xtap.daemon        # stop
launchctl print gui/$(id -u)/com.xtap.daemon          # status
tail -f ~/.xtap/daemon-stderr.log                     # logs
```

**Linux (systemd):**
```bash
systemctl --user restart com.xtap.daemon   # restart
systemctl --user stop com.xtap.daemon      # stop
systemctl --user status com.xtap.daemon    # status
journalctl --user -u com.xtap.daemon -f    # logs
```

**Windows (Scheduled Task, PowerShell):**
```powershell
Stop-ScheduledTask -TaskName xTapDaemon; Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName xTapDaemon  # restart
Stop-ScheduledTask -TaskName xTapDaemon                                            # stop
Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName xTapDaemon                                             # status
Get-Content ~\.xtap\daemon-stderr.log -Tail 50 -Wait                               # logs
```

## Testing

```bash
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v
node --test tests/*.test.mjs
```

CI runs these on every push to `main` with coverage uploaded to [Codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/mkubicek/xTap).

Parser fixture packs live under `tests/fixtures/`. Raw captures stay local in
`tests/fixtures/private-raw/` (gitignored), while committed anonymized packs
live in `tests/fixtures/sanitized/`. The anonymization methodology and review
checklist are documented in `tests/fixtures/FIXTURES.md`.
